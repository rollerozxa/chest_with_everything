# Chest With Everything
Lightweight and game-agnostic mod which adds a chest node containing every single node, item and tool registered inside. Useful for development purposes in games written from scratch or for server operators. You can give yourself it by doing `/giveme chest_with_everything:chest` if you have the necessary privileges.

By default, it doesn't show items with the `not_in_creative_inventory` group, which primarily contains technical items and nodes. If you do want to show them, there is a setting to override this behaviour.

Based off of Development Test's "Chest of Everything" mod.
